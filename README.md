# Hardcore Space Exploration Game
I like space exploration games.

Elite: Dangerous (conceptually), Star Citizen (visually), and No Man's Sky (technically) are all inspiring to me.

I want to make a hardcore space exploration game,

where most things *can* and probably *will* kill you,

where your primary goal is to make detailed writings about your findings,

where you can make a mark, an impact on the universe,

where all of your writings permanently remain within an online database,

where you can meet civilizations and wander their cities, get to know the locals of a world or star system, gain a positive or negative reputation with them, and go down in ***their*** history books,

where your structures, space stations, accidents, and your overall presence in the universe, are all able to remain where you left them,

**where if you die, you return to the very beginning, to start over.**
